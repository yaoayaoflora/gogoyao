# Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and also rotated by some arbitrary number, 
# find if a given ‘key’ is present in it.
# 
# Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ in the rotated array. If the ‘key’ is not present, return -1. 
# You can assume that the given array does not have any duplicates.
