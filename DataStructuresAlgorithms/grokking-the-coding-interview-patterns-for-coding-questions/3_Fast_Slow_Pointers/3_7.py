# We are given an array containing positive and negative numbers. Suppose the array contains a number ‘M’ 
# at a particular index. Now, if ‘M’ is positive we will move forward ‘M’ indices and if ‘M’ is negative 
# move backwards ‘M’ indices. You should assume that the array is circular which means two things:
# 1. If, while moving forward, we reach the end of the array, we will jump to the first element to 
# continue the movement.
# 2. If, while moving backward, we reach the beginning of the array, we will jump to the last element to 
# continue the movement.
# 
# Write a method to determine if the array has a cycle. The cycle should have more than one element 
# and should follow one direction which means the cycle should not contain both forward and backward movements.
