# Given a set of distinct numbers, find all of its permutations.
# 
# Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the elements of the set. For example, {1, 2, 3} has the following six permutations:
# 1. {1, 2, 3}
# 2. {1, 3, 2}
# 3. {2, 1, 3}
# 4. {2, 3, 1}
# 5. {3, 1, 2}
# 6. {3, 2, 1}
# If a set has ‘n’ distinct elements it will have $n!$ permutations.
