# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two 
# baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only 
# restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
# 
# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree. You will pick one
# fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
# 
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
