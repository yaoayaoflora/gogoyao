# Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation, for example, 8 can be represented as
# “1000” in binary and 7 as “0111” in binary.
# 
# The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary that we get when we
# change every 1 to a 0 and every 0 to a 1. For example, the binary complement of “1010” is “0101”.
